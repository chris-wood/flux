# flux

## Overview

Flux is an imperative programing language that compiles to *executable 
packet flows.* The intent is to allow the network behavior of an application
to be programmatically encoded without dealing with the application-layer 
details. The ultimate goal is to enable better experimentation of CCN-based
applications, forwarders, and (forwarding, caching, etc.) strategies.
